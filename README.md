- frugal_ai_practical_work_subject.pdf = Instructions for the practial works

### Starter files
- matmul.py = Starter file for the Python part of the PW
- matmul.c = Starter file for the C part of the PW
- matmul_vect.c = Starter file for matmul v4, v5 and v6 implementations in C
- GPU_matmul_demo = Starter file for the GPU part of the practical work (to open in a Colab environment)
- frugal_ai_opt_ann.ipynb = Starter file for part II of the PW on ANN optimization (to open in a Colab environment)

### Correction files
- frugal_ai_matmul_automated.ipynb = fully automatized version of all whole matmul part of the PW for Python, C and parallelization (to open in a Colab environment)
- matmul_correction.py = Correction for the python part of the PW
- matmul_correction.c = Correction for all C implementations (v1 to v6) including parallelization of all versions
- frugal_ai_opt_ann_correction.ipynb = Proposed solution for the ANN optimization part. Can load a pre-trained model on the last cell (to open in a Colab environment).
